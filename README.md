0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

**Objectives:**

1. **LIFO and FIFO:** LIFO stands for "Last In, First Out," which means that the last element added to a collection is the first one to be removed. FIFO stands for "First In, First Out," where the first element added is the first to be removed.

2. **Stack:** A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO principle. You add elements to the top and remove from the top. It's useful for managing function calls, undo operations, and more.

3. **Common Implementations:** Stacks and queues can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. Arrays provide constant-time access, while linked lists offer dynamic sizing.

4. **Use Cases:** Stacks are used for function call management, expression evaluation, and backtracking. Queues are used in scenarios like task scheduling, breadth-first search, and print job management.

5. **Global Variables:** Global variables are accessible from any part of a program, but their usage should be minimized due to potential issues like naming conflicts and difficulties in debugging.

6. **Queue:** A queue is another linear data structure that follows the FIFO principle. Elements are added to the rear and removed from the front. It's useful for managing tasks in a fair order.

**Tasks:**

1. **Push and Pall:** Implement the "push" opcode to add an element to the stack. Implement the "pall" opcode to print all elements in the stack from top to bottom.

2. **Pint:** Implement the "pint" opcode to print the value at the top of the stack followed by a new line.

3. **Pop:** Implement the "pop" opcode to remove the top element from the stack.

4. **Swap:** Implement the "swap" opcode to exchange the positions of the top two elements on the stack.

5. **Add:** Implement the "add" opcode to remove the top two elements, add them, and push the result back onto the stack.

6. **Nop:** Implement the "nop" opcode that doesn't perform any action
